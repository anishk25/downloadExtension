Download Master
====

Download Master is a chrome extension that simplifies the process of organizing downloads. A download
is organized by the URL it came from and its file type. The user provides a specific path for a URL,
and when the file is downloaded from that URL it is automatically put into the user selected folder.
The downloads are further organized into folders by their file type(pdf,doc,exe,txt, etc.)
